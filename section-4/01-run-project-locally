# Run the project Locally

In this lecture we will use the `docker compose` which is installed as part of `docker`.

Clone this repo to the local machine - https://github.com/Devops-projects-Sri/ultimate-devops-project-demo.git

Go to the directory of cloned repo and run `docker compose down` follwed by `docker compose up -d`.

If you only used 8G to create a volume during ec2 creation, this might have to be expanded for the installation of the container images for this project. Use the following commands:
        
        To check partition info and to note down name of the partition assigned to root folder:
        
        ```bash
        df -h
        lsblk
        ```
        
        To increase the size of the partition (assuming xvda1 is the root partition):
        ```bash
        sudo apt install cloud-guest-utils
        sudo growpart /dev/xvda1
        ```

        To verify partition size has been changed:
        ```bash
        lsblk
        ```

        To update the filesystem so that it reflects the size change for root directory:
        ```bash
        sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1
        ```
        To run containers in the background:
        ```bash
        docker compose up -d
        ```
    To access the project on the browser, AWS security group rules need to be modified. Note: SG blocks everything by default, NACL allows everything by default. Edit SG of EC2 to allow SSH from anywhere and port 8080 from anywhere. Access frontend by using http://<IP-of-EC2>:8080.
